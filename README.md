# FizzBuzz_In_Every_Language

This Repo will document my attempt to do FizzBuzz in as many languages as possible.

## Rules

* Every language must be tested.
* Each language must be Test Driven as much as possible.
* The aim is not to solve FizzBuzz in a smart or best way - but rather to solve it.



1. Ruby + RSpec
2. Javascript + Jasmine
