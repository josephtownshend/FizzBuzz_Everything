This Repo will document my attempt to do FizzBuzz in as many languages as possible.

## Rules

* Every language must be tested and Test Driven.
* The aim is not to solve FizzBuzz in a smart - but rather to solve it.


## Languages

1. Ruby + RSpec - DONE
2. Javascript + Jasmine - DONE
3. Python + Unittest - DONE
4. Java + Junit - DONE
5. Go
6. Scala
7. C#
8. Swift


## Notes

* More esoteric languages!
  * Are there any esoteric / weird langs that have testing frameworks?
* Try different solutions.
  * Extend previous solutions to loop through 1..100
